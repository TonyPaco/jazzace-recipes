    <string>Downloads latest version of Lightwright (John McKernon Software), creates a package
from the downloaded app, and then copies the package to the DeployStudio packages repository.
Input keys:
- LW_VERSION (from the download recipe) selects which major version of Lightwright to download.
  This recipe supports version 6 and later.
- DS_PKGS_PATH is the path for the Packages folder in the DeployStudio repository (trailing slash not required/desired).
  The path does not need to be on the same volume as the cache, as the pkg is being duplicated.
- DS_NAME is what the final package will be called in DeployStudio, regardless of what was generated by the parent recipe.
  It defaults to %NAME% (just the app name).
Note that the .pkg recipe has a StopProcessingIf processor to avoid redundant work if no update is present.
