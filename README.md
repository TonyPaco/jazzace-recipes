autopkg-recipes
===============

Current space for my AutoPkg recipes. I am asking to have my recipes moved to the [AutoPkg project](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg), so they will be removed from here once that happens.

If you use DeployStudio and you would like to have AutoPkg feed your Packages repo in DS with the latest versions, use my recipes with the .ds tag or make your own by using my Template.ds to leverage existing .pkg recipes as parents.
