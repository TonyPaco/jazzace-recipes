===============

These are [AutoPkg recipes](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg), mostly related to making AutoPkg feed a DeployStudio repository (so if there is no existing .pkg recipe, that is also created). There are other original recipes, usually related to my work supporting performing and visual artists at a University.

The DeployStudio recipes use the .ds suffix. You could use such recipes to move a copy to any location, not just DeployStudio, since the package is copied, not moved. I've also included a template if you wish to create more DeployStudio recipes that leverage existing .pkg recipes as parents.
