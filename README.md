autopkg-recipes
===============

Current playspace for my AutoPkg recipes. When it has greater utility, I will ask to have it moved to the [AutoPkg project.](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg)

If you use DeployStudio and you would like to have AutoPkg feed your Packages repo in DS with the latest versions, use my recipes with the .ds tag or make your own by using my Template.ds to leverage existing .pkg recipes as parents.
