	<string>Downloads latest version of Lightwright, creates a package from the downloaded app,
and then copies the package to a local path of your choosing.
Input keys:
- DS_PKGS_PATH is the destination path for the copy. A trailing slash is not required/desired.
  The path does not need to be on the same volume as the cache, as the pkg is being duplicated.
- DS_NAME is what the final package will be called, regardless of what was generated by the parent recipe.
  It defaults to %NAME% (just the app name).
Note that the .pkg recipe has a StopProcessingIf processor to avoid redundant work if no update is present.
