	<string>Downloads latest version of NoteAbilityPro 3, extracts the package, and then copies it to a local path of your choosing.
If there is no new installer, the file will not be copied (processing will be stopped by the parent recipe).
Input keys:
- DS_PKGS_PATH is the destination path for the copy. A trailing slash is not required/desired.
  The path does not need to be on the same volume as the cache, as the pkg is being duplicated.
- DS_NAME is what the final package will be called, regardless of what was extracted by the parent recipe.
  It defaults to %NAME% (just the app name).
