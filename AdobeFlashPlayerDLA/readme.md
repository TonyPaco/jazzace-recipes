AdobeFlashPlayerDLA Recipes
===========================

These recipes were designed to be used by SysAdmins who have a Distribution License Agreement (DLA) with Adobe (that's all of you, right?). You used the super secret URI that Adobe provided you to gather the information that this recipe needs, which you enter in an override.

And then in October 2016, Adobe started making agreement holders login with an Adobe ID on top of that. Rather than go through the handstands those who developed the Adobe CCP recipes did, I have decided to completely remove my Flash recipes. The Flash Player recipes in the main AutoPkg repo work just fine and probably will until such time as Flash is discontinued.
