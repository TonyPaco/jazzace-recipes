Finale Update Recipes
=====================

These recipes only fetch the latest updater for Finale 2014 when using the default SPARKLE_FEED_URL. While 2014.5 was technically a free update, it came in the form of a full installer, which must be downloaded in an authenticated session. Thus, the current recipe will continue to fetch the 2014d updater.

Attempts have been made to make the recipe work for v.25, but problems with the Sparkle feed have prevented it. If that gets sorted out, the download recipe will be updated to support Code Signature verification.
